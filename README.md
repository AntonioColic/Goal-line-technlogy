# Goal-line-technology
I made this project for a presentation in college, and by the way, for fun.
Therefore, it is about goal line technology. For this project I used an arduino uno board, two ky-003 hall effect sensors, oled display 128x32, magnet and male to female jumper wires. The system works on the principle of a magnetic field using a hall effect sensor. Along the way I also implemented a goal counter for home and away so you can play around.
